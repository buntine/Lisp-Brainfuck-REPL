BRAINFUCK REPL

ABOUT
  A very basic brainfuck repl (Read -> Evaluate -> Print -> Loop)
  implemented in Scheme.
  Brainfuck, an esoteric programming language, was originally
  designed by Urban Muller in 1993.

  You will probably notice that it's really more like a REL, as
  brainfuck instructions don't have explicit values.
 
  Main memory is represented as a vector of unrestricted
  length (you decide).
 
  I've added two additional instructions:
    ! : Prints the contents of memory and the instruction
        pointer to stdout.
    @ : Resets all machine state (clears memory, pointers).
 
  Usage (tested with tinyscheme):
      (load "brainfuck_repl.scm")

  To end the REPL, just type Ctrl+c.

FEEDBACK
  This is my first LISP program. Please give me feedback if I've implemented something horrendously. :)
